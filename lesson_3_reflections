When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository is the one which we will make local changes,typically this local repository is on our own computer. A remote repository is the one on the server. git is a distributed version control system.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not want all of the changes that are made on the remote repository. Hence, you may not want the changes to be pulled automatically.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forking is copying someone else's github repo onto your own github repository
branches is the commit branch you make on the local repo
clones can be from github to local or local to local repos

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So that there is backup?

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

It would definitely be harder because the changes will be saved without tracking in the history. With git or github, the changes may be easily tracked.
