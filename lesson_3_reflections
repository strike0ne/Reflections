When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository is the one which we will make local changes,typically this local repository is on our own computer. A remote repository is the one on the server. git is a distributed version control system.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not want all of the changes that are made on the remote repository. Hence, you may not want the changes to be pulled automatically.
